# Minishell
Projet 42 :
Reproduce some behaviors of bash --posix :

Pipe
Redirections >, >>, <, <<
Builtin : echo with -n option, ls, pwd, unset, export, env, cd
Quote and double quote management
Parsing advice
Use enum for clarity for your token types typedef enum e_type { WORD=0, COMMAND, COMMAND_OPTION, WHITE_SPACE, QUOTE, D_QUOTE, EQUAL, ERROR, PIPE, EXPAND, REDIR_RIGHT, REDIR_LEFT, D_REDIR_RIGHT, HEREDOC, EMPTY } t_type;

Use a double linked list to keep your token typedef struct s_token { t_type type; char *content; int id; struct s_token *next; struct s_token *previous; } t_token;

Delete redirection, quote and double quote once you have expanded them

---> Succeeded with 101%
